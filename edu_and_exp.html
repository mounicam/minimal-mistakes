        <h5>Software Development Intern at Big Data Technologies, Amazon <span class="align-right"> June 2014 - August 2014 </span></h5>
        <p class="paddingbottom"> Developed natural language interface to help customers communicate with Grasshopper, our SQL query builder system. In Grasshopper user interface, the users can drag and drop query attributes and conditions, which are ultimately converted into SQL query. The goal of the project was to select these attributes or conditions using natural language rather than users drag-and-drop actions. For this project, extracted table/schema names and query conditions from the input natural language
          sentence and populated these entities in a pre-de ned Grasshopper query template.
