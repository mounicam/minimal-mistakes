        <h5> Cross-Cultural Analysis using Twitter <span class="align-right"> Spring 2014 - Spring 2015 </span> </h5>
        <h6> Advisor: Dr. Lyle Ungar </h6>
        <p class="paddingbottom">Goal of the project was to capture the different sources and interpretations of well-being across various cultures or countries. The idea was to capture the context of sentiment words and analyze their distribution across countries. The project
          was a part of World Well Being Project (WWBP). </p>
        <p class="paddingbottom"> For this project, implemented country filter to classify tweets, extracted n-grams highly correlating with positive/negative sentiment words and analyzed the results with word clouds. Also experimented with topics instead of n-grams and positive/negative
          categories of sentiment lexica rather than sentiment words. Assisted with similar experiments on Spanish tweets and Chinese microblogs form Weibo. </p>
        <p class="paddingbottom">This project is written as Independent Study Project on the transcript. </p>

        <h5>CROVHD <span class="align-right">Monsoon/Fall 2011 - Spring 2013</span> </h5>
        <h6> Advisor: Dr. Kamalakar Karlapalem </h6>
        <p class="paddingbottom"> Developed new visualization system called CROVHD (Concentric Rings of Visualization of High Dimensional Data) to visualize the highdimensional data as a 2-D representation. Extended this system to 3-D Cone visualization to visualize k-nearest
          neighbours.

        <h5>Sentiment Analysis of restaurant reviews</h5>
        <p class="paddingbottom"> Developed a system to predict the star rating of restaurant reviews given the review text and other review properties.The rating system consisted of three stages: data preprocessing to reduce the dimensionality of text data from words to informative
          word clusters, individual labels prediction with an ensemble of classifiers and weighted voting of these labels for the final rating. </p>

        <p class="paddingbottom"> Developed a competitive task where the goal was to improve the accuracy of crowdsourced trans- lations using translation and other metadata properties. Gathered data for the task, chose an evaluation metric to rank the solution for leaderboard,came
          up with the baseline for the task and experimented with di erent approaches to rank the quality of crowdsourced translations. </p>

        <h5>Language Research on Bhojpuri</h5>
        <p class="paddingbottom"> Researched on the syntax, morphology, writing system and distribution of speakers for a low resource Indian language called Bhojpuri. Also gathered monolingual data for this language by crawling the Bhojpuri news sites and built a language identication
          system using this data.</p>
