              <h5> Pairwise Neural Ranking for Hashtag Segmentation (Fall 2018 - Spring 2019) </h5>
              <p>
                Hashtags are often employed on social media and beyond to add metadata to a textual utterance with the goal of
                increasing discoverability, aiding search, or providing additional semantics. However, the semantic content of hashtags
                is not straightforward to infer as these represent ad-hoc conventions which frequently include multiple words joined together
                and can include abbreviations and unorthodox spellings. We build a dataset of 12,594 hashtags split into individual
                segments and propose a set of approaches for hashtag segmentation by framing it as a pairwise ranking problem between candidate
                segmentations. Our novel neural approaches demonstrate 24.6% error reduction in hashtag segmentation accuracy compared to the
                current state-of-the-art method. Finally, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of hashtag semantics obtained through
                segmentation is useful for downstream applications such as sentiment analysis, for which we achieved a 2.6% increase in average
                recall on the SemEval 2017 sentiment analysis dataset.

                <h5>Lexical Simplification using Neural Readability Ranker (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018) </h5>
                <p>
                    Current lexical simplification approaches rely heavily on heuristics and corpus level features
                    that do not always align with human judgment. We create a human-rated word-complexity lexicon
                    of 15,000 English words and propose a novel neural readability ranking model with a Gaussian-based
                    feature vectorization layer that utilizes these human ratings to measure the complexity of any
                    given word or phrase. Our model performs better than the state-of-the-art systems for different
                    lexical simplification tasks and evaluation datasets. Additionally, we also produce SimplePPDB++,
                    a lexical resource of over 10 million simplifying paraphrase rules, by applying our model to the Paraphrase Database (PPDB).

                    The project was a part of World Well Being Project (WWBP). We captured the
                    different sources and interpretations of well-being across various cultures or countries.
                    using the context of sentiment words and their distribution across countries.

                <p>
                    We developed a new visualization system called CROVHD (Concentric Rings of Visualization
                    of High Dimensional Data) to visualize the high dimensional data as a 2-D representation.
                    We also extended this system to 3-D Cone visualization to visualize k-nearest neighbours.
